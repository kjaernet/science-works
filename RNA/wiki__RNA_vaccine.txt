In 1989, the first successful transfection of mRNA packaged within a liposomal nanoparticle into a cell was published.[3][15][16] In 1990, "naked" (or unprotected) mRNA was injected into the muscle of mice.[3][17] These studies were the first evidence that in vitro transcribed mRNA could deliver the genetic information to produce proteins within living cell tissue.[3]

In 1993, liposome-encapsulated RNA was shown to stimulate T-cells in vivo, and in 1994, RNA proved useful as a vaccine to elicit both humoral and cellular immune response against a pathogen.[3][18][19]

In 2005, successful application of modified nucleosides as a medium to get mRNA inside cells without setting off the body's defense system was reported.[3][20] In 2010, the mRNA-focused biotechnology company, Moderna, was started to develop mRNA biotechnologies.[20][3]

In 2010, US government agency DARPA launched a biotech research program called ADEPT as part of its mission to develop emerging technologies for the US military.[21] In 2011, DARPA recognized the potential of nucleic acid technology for defense against pandemics and began to invest in the field through ADEPT.[21][22] DARPA's grants were seen as a vote of confidence which in turn encouraged other government agencies and private investors to also invest in mRNA technology.[22] In 2013, DARPA awarded a $25 million grant to Moderna.[23]

In 2012, mRNA was proposed for immunization purposes.[24][25] mRNA drugs for cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases, and selected targets for cancer were initially linked to serious side effects.[26][27] mRNA vaccines for human use have been studied for rabies, Zika virus disease, cytomegalovirus, and influenza.[28]

In December 2020, Moderna and BioNTech obtained FDA emergency use authorization for their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which had been funded by Operation Warp Speed.[20] On 2 December 2020, seven days after its final eight-week trial, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), became the first global medicines regulator in history to approve an mRNA vaccine, granting emergency authorization for Pfizer–BioNTech's BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine for widespread use.[7][8][29] On 11 December 2020, the FDA gave emergency use authorization for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.[30]
